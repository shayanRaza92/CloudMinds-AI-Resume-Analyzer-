## Technologies Used
Here is a simple breakdown of the tools I used to build this:

- **React:** Used to build the website and the items you see and click on.
- **AWS S3:** A safe place to store the resumes you upload and host the website files.
- **AWS Lambda:** The "worker" that runs the code for analyzing resumes without needing a full server.
- **AWS CloudFront:** Makes the website fast by serving it from a location closest to you.
- **Groq AI (Llama 3):** The brain that actually reads the resume and gives smart feedback.
- **Recharts:** Used to create the cool charts and score gauges you see.
- **Lucide React:** Provides the clean icons used throughout the site.
- **AWS CDK:** The master plan that sets up all the cloud parts automatically.
